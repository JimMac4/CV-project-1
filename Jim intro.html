  <p class="my-bio">Over the past eleven years, I have worked my way from being from being an entry-level teacher of English to a specialist in TEFL, a sympathetic, positive and passionate manager and a results orientated director of a school.

        In my spare time, of which there is very little I like to play chess and learn new openings as well as watch a variety of sports. I have been known to play the odd sport but not that often.

            Having quit recruitment, I moved to Spain with everything I owned to start a new career in teaching. I quickly found this to be extremely rewarding and enjoyable. 7 years and a host of promotions later and I was part of a management team running a centre of over a 1000 students before moving south and undertaking content creation.

            In Ukraine I was fortunate enough to become Director of a centre of a 1000 students with a staff over 20 teachers and numerous admin staff. Through the pandemic, we not only survived as a school but managed to get back to near pre-pandemic levels before the invasion. This period was the most challenging and awesome experience of my entire career.

            Having been forced to move back to the UK, I am now looking to expand my skill-set and move into developing. I also hope to maintain my teaching and management skills as well as my client-facing skills.
